# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! Follow these steps when contributing changes:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes, keeping them focused and well-documented.
3. Run formatting checks locally (see `ci.yml`) and ensure no obvious regressions.
4. Open a Pull Request with a clear title and description.

PR checklist (fill in before requesting review):
- [ ] Does the PR have a descriptive title and summary?
- [ ] Did you run the CI checks and fix formatting issues if any?
- [ ] Are new UI changes accessible and responsive?
- [ ] Did you update `README.md` or `RELEASE_NOTES.md` for visible changes?
